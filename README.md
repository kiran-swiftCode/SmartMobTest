# SmartMobTest

what I have done here are : 

Downloaded latest 10 photos from the url you have given me . 
Search the source of the image though its id . and displayed its images in collectionview . Like caurosel 
we can tap to caurosel image to zoom it 
Autolayout done .. looks okay even in ipad sizes


tried to do in MVC framework

**Tools 
 Alamofire 
 AlamofireImages
 Promisekit
 GSImageViewerController
 
 


***I have not done search functionality , because I didnot get any resources with many keywords i tried . ie No ressult
*** Unit testing I will be doing in next version , I did test everything manually this time .
