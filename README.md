# SmartMobTest

**** what I have done here are : 

Downloaded latest 10 photos from the url you have given me . 
Search the source of the image through its id and displayed its images in collectionview, like caurosel . 
We can tap to caurosel image to zoom it 
Autolayout done .. looks okay even in ipad sizes
Compatiable @ iOS 10.1 or higher
Tried to do in MVC framework

**Tools 
 Alamofire 
 AlamofireImages
 Promisekit
 GSImageViewerController
 
 
 


***I have not done search functionality , because I didnot get any resources with many keywords i tried . ie No ressult
*** Unit testing I will be doing in next version , I did test everything manually this time .
